# WEbCrawler
Created an fully functional webcrawler bot(spider) that crawls multiple webpages within a website which scraps out reference links( within same domain) and stores them in a file.

To run this program
First ensure you have installed python and beautifulsoup in your machine
Then set homepage variable(HOME_PAGE) in main.py to your choice of website
Then run the program

Output:
Within the project directory, a new folder named webcrawler would be created( if no error would have contanined),
within the crawled file links would be added.
